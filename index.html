                <p class="country-text">Nicaragua (Spanish: República de Nicaragua)
                    , is the largest country in Central America, bordered by 
                    Honduras to the north, the Caribbean to the east, Costa Rica
                    to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Managua is 
                    the country's capital and largest city. As of 2015, it was 
                    estimated to be the second largest city in Central America. 
                    Nicaragua's multiethnic population of six million includes 
                    people of mestizo, Indigenous, European and African heritage. 
                    The main language is Spanish. Indigenous tribes on the Mosquito 
                    Coast speak their own languages and English. 
                    The mixture of cultural traditions has generated substantial 
                    diversity in folklore, cuisine, music, and literature, particularly
                    the latter, given the literary contributions of Nicaraguan poets
                    and writers such as Rubén Darío. Known as the "land of lakes and
                    volcanoes",Nicaragua is also home to the Bosawás Biosphere Reserve,
                    the second-largest rainforest of the Americas. The biological 
                    diversity, warm tropical climate and active volcanoes make Nicaragua
                    an increasingly popular tourist destination. Nicaragua co-founded 
                    the United Nations and is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement,
                    Organization of American States, Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples
                    of Our America, and Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.
